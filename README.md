# P of EAA: FE edition

This repository was created during learning of M.Fowler "Patterns of enterprise application architecture" book.
It contains some examples of the described patterns in typescript. Most of the patterns in the book somehow
related to databases directly, since we don't have the database, as is, on the frontend the repository also contains
some interpretations of patterns that can be applied on the FE as well.

## Examples

Example contains 3 parts:

- Pattern description (usually it is taken from the M.Fowler official site).
- Solution of the problem that described in each block. F.e. we have the `readme` file for business-logic where the case for every
pattern is described
- Drawbacks - possible drawbacks of usage.

I'm not trying to be 100% accurate in each example in terms of the possible cases that we might encounter
during production development like errors handling etc.
