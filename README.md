# P of EAA: FE edition

This repository created during learning of M.Fowler patterns of enterprise application architecture book.
It contains some examples of the described patterns in typescript. Most of the patterns in the book somehow
related to databases directly, since we don't have the database, as is, on the frontend the repository also contains
some interpretations of patterns that can be applied on the FE as well.
